## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn how to use variables to store data in their programs.

## Resources

For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/60787262/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Ghostbusters.sb2

## Learning Objectives

+ Variables;
+ Random numbers.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges

+ "More randomness" - using random numbers;
+ "Adding a sound" - consolidating the learning of sounds;
+ "More objects" - applying skills to create another game object.

## Frequently Asked Questions

+ If children find it difficult to click the ghosts without dragging them around, they can play the game in fullscreen mode, in which ghosts aren't draggable.
