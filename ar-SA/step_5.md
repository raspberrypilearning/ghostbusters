Each time a player clicks on a ghost, their score should increase.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- `When the green flag is clicked`{:class=”blockevents”}, your `score`{:class=”blockdata”} variable should be `set to 0`{:class=”blockdata”}. The Stage is the best place to add this code. `When the ghost sprite is clicked`{:class=”blockevents”}, the `score`{:class=”blockdata”} should be `changed by 1`{:class=”blockdata”}. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you will need to use: ![screenshot](images/ghost-score-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's how to score points by clicking ghosts: ![screenshot](images/ghost-score-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---
