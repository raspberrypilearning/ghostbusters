## Adding a timer

+ Create a new variable called 'time'.

+ Can you add a timer to your Stage to give your player only 10 seconds to catch as many ghosts as possible?
    
    Your timer should:
    
    + Start at 10 seconds
    + Count down every second
    
    The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- `When the green flag is clicked`, your `time` variable should be `set to 10`. It should then `change by -1` every second `until it reaches 0`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you will need to use: ![screenshot](images/ghost-timer-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's how to add the timer to your game: ![screenshot](images/ghost-timer-code.png)

+ Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score?
    
    If your game is too easy, you can:
    
    + Give the player less time
    + Make the ghosts appear less often
    + Make the ghosts smaller
    
    Change and test your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
