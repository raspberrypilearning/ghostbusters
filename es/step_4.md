\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- You want your ghost to `go to` a random position on the stage before appearing each time. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- There are two sets of code blocks you can use. This one: ![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-1.png) Or this one: ![screenshot](images/ghost-random-blocks-2.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Your code should look either like this: ![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-1.png) Or it can look like this: ![screenshot](images/ghost-random-code-2.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---
